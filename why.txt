Web design from scratch: vanilla HTML, CSS & JS

Pros:
-> very lightweight website, no unneccessary bloating through frameworks and libraries
(like wordpress, bootstrap...)   -> better performance 
-> better reliability, no dependencies (e.g bugs in modules/updates etc.)
-> easier deployment, no CMS for WP etc.
-> better security without unneccessary addons
-> easier custom features & updates

Cons:
-> a lot more work: everything is custom code
-> WP, CMS easier for customer to understand

Argument for simple websites, not for highly complex web applications

How to get started:
- Mobile first, media queries for table, desktop later
- have divs and sub-divs for everything, with proper class names!
- separate every section properly
